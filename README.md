# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to our Movie Recommendation System, where movie suggestions go beyond the ordinary. This intelligent application blends advanced recommendation strategies, including Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Recommendation, and Non-Personalized Approaches, to curate a personalized and engaging movie-watching experience.

## üîç Problem Statement

Finding the perfect movie can be a challenge, especially for new users. Our system addresses this by seamlessly transitioning from non-personalized recommendations to advanced models. Whether you're a seasoned critic or a first-time viewer, our system adapts to your preferences.


## üéØ Recommendation Approaches

### A) Simple Recommender System - Average Weight

The Simple Recommender system offers universal movie suggestions by considering overall popularity and occasional genre preferences. This model prioritizes movies with higher popularity and critical acclaim, assuming they are more likely to be appreciated by the average audience.

**Implementation:**
- Movies are sorted based on ratings and popularity.
- Top movies from this sorted list are presented.
- Users can specify a genre for personalized recommendations.

**Mathematical Model (IMDB's Weighted Rating Formula):**

- **v:** Number of votes for the movie
- **m:** Minimum votes required to be listed in the chart (set at the 85th percentile)
- **R:** Average rating of the movie
- **C:** Mean vote across the entire dataset

**Functionality:**
- Create Top 250 movies chart.
- Develop charts tailored to specific genres.

### B) Content-Based Recommendation System

Enhance the personalization of recommendations with a Content-Based Recommendation engine. This engine calculates similarities between movies using specific criteria, suggesting movies that closely resemble a particular film enjoyed by the user.

**Focus Areas:**
- Movie Overviews
- Movie Cast
- Director
- Keywords
- Genre

**Working Mechanism:**
- Content-Based Recommendation focuses on intrinsic movie features, such as Movie Cast,Director and genres.
- Understand your preferences through the genres, favourtive cast and the director you enjoy.
- Predict and suggest movies with similar content, adding a layer of personalization based on thematic elements.
